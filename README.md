# ArduinoIRToKeyboard

This does exactly what it says on the tin, it takes an IR Code from an IR Sensor Module and Presses Keys on the Keyboard.  

It works with Arduino Leonardo.

You will need an IR Sensor Module.  I used : KY-022 Infrared IR Sensor Receiver Module For Arduino

Signalex version works with a Â£1 remote, available here:
